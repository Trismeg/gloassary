    description={An AND gate is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output that performs logical conjunction. The output of an AND gate is true only when all of the inputs are true. If one or more of an AND gate's inputs are false, then the output of the AND gate is false. For example, if you want to be the teather in the school, you should be smart and nice. If you are not smart,and you are nice,you cannot be the teacher.  Only both smart and nice can be the teacher.}
