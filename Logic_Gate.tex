    description={Logic Gate perform basic logical functions and are the fundamental building blocks of integrated circuits. Most of the logic gates takes true or false as an input which can also be represented as 1 and 0. After the input go through the gates, it will transfer in to an output depend on the situation of the code and the type of the gate. Furthermore, logic gate is divided into 7 types of gate which are AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and NOT gate. AND: True when A and B are both True. NAND: False only when A and B are both true. OR: True if either A or B are True. NOR: True only when A and B are both False. XOR: True if either A or B are True, but False if both are True. XNOR: True if A and B are both True or both False. NOT: True if input is False; False if input is True.}
